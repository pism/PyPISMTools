The ``PyPISMTools`` module
======================
 
PyPISMTools is a collection of classes and functions to evaluate PISM studies by
providing tools for binning and histogram plotting. It also includes
helper functions and wrappers for things like unit conversion,
defining figure sizes and parameters, and more.
